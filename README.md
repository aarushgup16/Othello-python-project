# Othello-python-project
This Python project is a full implementation of the Othello game using 2D lists and turn-based logic. It detects valid moves in all 8 directions, flips opponent pieces automatically, tracks scores, handles invalid moves, skips turns when needed, and announces the final winner after counting discs.
